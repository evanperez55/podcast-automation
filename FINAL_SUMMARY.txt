================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT MATCHING
================================================================================

This analysis uses KEYWORD-BASED matching (not AI) due to API credit limits.

Why only 3 matches?
  - Keyword matching is very conservative
  - Cannot understand semantic similarity
  - Requires exact keyword overlap

For better results:
  - Add Anthropic API credits ($5-20)
  - Run: python match_topics_to_episodes.py
  - Expected: 50-100+ matches with AI semantic analysis

BOTTOM LINE: 952+ topics remain available for future episodes!
